About 35% of the world's food is grown on small farms (less than 2 hectares), especially in low and middle-income nations. There is a lack of trustworthy information regarding these farms, which makes support and policy-making challenging. Machine learning and Earth Observation data from satellites like Sentinel-2 can enhance agricultural monitoring, crop mapping, and disaster risk management for these tiny farms. Our aim of this project is to develop various relations between spectral bands of light from the Sentinal-2 satellite and use their characteristics to classify different types of crops present in the fields of Northern Indian states particularly Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, and Bihar.
